# epic-tts
Tabletop simulator scripts for Epic Armageddon. 

The main script epic.ttslua (Global TTS script) has two features. 
1. Uses scripting buttons, and TTS vector graphics, to draw a range finder around models.
1. UI for creating battle reports, by recording your actions and adding a describing text.

The saveposition.ttslua is used to record hidden coordinates for e.g. Drop Pods, Tunnelers or Orbital Barrages. The script should be added to the item that needs its coordinates recorded, e.g. the Drop Pod.
